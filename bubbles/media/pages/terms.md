# Terms and Conditions of Rental

I, the renter, have checked the equipment and found it all to be in working
order at the time of renting. During the rental period I am personally
responsible for the diving equipment. I understand that the UCT Underwater Club
reserves the right to withhold my deposit should the gear not be returned
timeously or in working order, reasonable wear and tear excluded. In addition, I
understand that I am responsible for my own conduct while diving and the UCT
Underwater Club is not liable for any harm that I suffer due to my own
negligence while using the equipment. I have read and understood the conditions
for renting equipment from the UCT Underwater Club. I will abide by these rules,
and will report any and all faults and malfunctions of items found during the
rental period to the equipment officer upon returning the equipment at the
latest.
