# Rentals

At the core of Bubbles is the rental system. This allows members to rent out
equipment that Bubbles manages. A rental has a life-cycle of three stages:

1.  The rental is _requested_ by a member
1.  The rental is then _rented_ once equipment is assigned to the member and
    they have taken posession of it.
1.  Once the member returns the equipment, the rental is considered _returned_.

Typically, a member [requests equipment](request_equipment) for their own
account, which then is displayed in the **Rental Queue** on the Admin screen. An
admin can also [add a rental](/admin/rentals/add/)
