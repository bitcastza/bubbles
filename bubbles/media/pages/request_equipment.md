Regular users can request equipment from a list of available types and sizes.
Requests are specific to a rental period that is pre-populated by a staff member.

The rental period is the period when the rental is valid. This is the time you
have the equipment and is responsible for it and belt weight refers to the
number of weights required on the weight belt.

The **Equipment** table is the list of equipment, and sizes that you intend on
renting. Items are selected from the **Add Equpment** drop-down menu and then
the size can be selected from the **Size** column for the corresponding item.

Once you are satisfied with the request details, read and accept the
[terms of rental](terms) and click **Submit**. You will now see a request under
**My Requests**, which you can update if you need to.
