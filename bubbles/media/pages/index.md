# Bubbles Documentation

Bubbles is an SCUBA equipment management system. It supports tracking equipment
and renting it to members. Logging in is done through Vula, thus uses your
UCT credentials.

After logging in, the user is presented with the home screen, which displays the
user's currently rented items, requested rentals and the predicted weather for
the next few days.

The links in the top right of the screen provide access to the other frequently
used part of the site. **Request Equipment** allows the user to request
equipment for future rental periods. **Log Out** logs the user out of their
current session and **Help** displays this help document.

Any equipment currently rented out by the user is listed in the **My Rentals**
list, while any rental requests are listed in the **My Requests** list. Requests
can be edited from the **My Requests** list.
